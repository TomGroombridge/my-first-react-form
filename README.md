# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). It is a simple blog application that allows you to view, create and update blog posts.

## Getting Started

Make sure you start by installing all the packages.

`npm install`

To start this application you will need to run 2 seperate commands.

`npm run start:json-server` 

This command will open a port at `3001` and run a fake json server with the blog data inside it.

`npm start`

This command will run the application in development mode. You can visit the application in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
